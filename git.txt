GIT Learning

Git is a version control tool that helps you track your code changes, restore older versions, and collaborate with teams.

1️⃣ Starting With Git

If you have a project folder containing your code, open the terminal inside that folder and run:

git init


This command initializes Git in your folder and starts tracking your files.

After initialization, Git creates a default branch, usually called:

main

2️⃣ Checking Status

To see which files are changed, untracked, or staged:

git status


This helps you know what Git is watching inside your folder.

3️⃣ Adding Files to Git

If you want to tell Git:
“Hey Git, I want to track these changes,"
you need to add them to the staging area.

Add all files:

git add .


Add a specific file:

git add index.html

4️⃣ Saving Changes: Commit

After adding, you save your changes inside Git by committing:

git commit -m "Added homepage layout"


Each commit is like a snapshot of your code at that moment.

5️⃣ Connecting to a Remote Repository

If you want to push your code to GitHub, GitLab, etc., add the remote:

git remote add origin https://github.com/user/project.git


To verify:

git remote -v

6️⃣ Pushing Code to Remote

To upload your commits:

git push origin main


If it’s your first push:

git push -u origin main

7️⃣ Pulling Latest Changes

Before working, always pull the latest code from GitHub:

git pull origin main


This avoids conflicts.

8️⃣ Branches

Branches help you work on features separately.

Create a new branch:

git branch feature-1


Move to the branch:

git checkout feature-1


Create + move in one step:

git checkout -b feature-UI

9️⃣ Merging Branches

After finishing your feature:

Switch to main:

git checkout main


Merge your feature into main:

git merge feature-UI

🔟 Handling Conflicts

If Git cannot merge automatically, it shows conflict markers in files.
Solve manually → save → then:

git add .
git commit

1️⃣1️⃣ Stashing Work

If mid-work you're asked to shift to another task, but your work isn’t ready to commit:

git stash


Later restore:

git stash pop

1️⃣2️⃣ Reverting Changes (Safe Rollback)

If a commit broke production but you want to keep history:

git revert <commit-id>


This creates a new commit that undoes the previous one.

1️⃣3️⃣ Resetting Changes (Dangerous)

Soft reset (keeps changes):

git reset --soft HEAD~1


Hard reset (deletes changes completely):

git reset --hard HEAD~1


Use hard reset carefully.

1️⃣4️⃣ Cherry-Picking (Pick Only One Commit)

If you want only one specific commit from another branch:

git cherry-pick <commit-id>


Useful for production hotfixes.

1️⃣5️⃣ Tags (For Releases)

To mark a stable release version:

git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

1️⃣6️⃣ Viewing Changes

See what has changed in code:

git diff


See commit history:

git log --oneline --graph
